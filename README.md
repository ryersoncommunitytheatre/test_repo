My name is *Bryan Chu* and I am editing this repository to **experiment with Github's edit system**. Here are three things about me:
  
1. I am a Computer Engineering Student
2. I have been with RCT for many, many years
3. I wrote the RCT Constitution!

In order to prove my mastery of formatting, I've created a link that will jump you back to the beginning of my section [here](#bryanlink)
